The auth_token config parameter is for use with Phantom instances. If both the token and username/password are given, the username and password will be used to authenticate to the Phantom instance.
<br><br>
Note that the IP (or name) being used must match the allowed IP in the remote Phantom instance's REST asset configuration.
<br><br>
In case the <b>phantom_server</b> configuration parameter is set to the current Phantom instance, i.e., the Phantom server through which the app is being used, then the <b>verify_certificate</b> should be set to False in the asset configuration.
<br><br>
For information on how to obtain an authorization token, see Provisioning an Authorization Token in the Phantom REST Overview documentation.
<br><br>
If the value provided in the <b>phantom_server</b> configuration parameter is 0.0.0.0 then the <b>test connectivity</b> passes successfully and the actions will run on the current phantom instance, i.e., the server through which the app is being used.
<br><br>
See <a href="https://my.phantom.us/kb/7/" target="_blank">KB article 7</a> and <a href="https://my.phantom.us/kb/16/" target="_blank">KB article 16</a> on how to create and verify a valid HTTPS certificate for your Phantom instance.
<br><br>
For security reasons, accessing 127.0.0.1 is not allowed.<br><br>

<p>
  The app uses HTTP/ HTTPS protocol for communicating with the phantom server. Below are the default ports used by Splunk SOAR.
